                <p>The German watchmaker Ferdinand Adolph Lange founded A Lange and Sohne in Glashutte, German, in 1845 after apprenticing with master watchmaker Johann Christian Friedrich Gutkaes in Dresden.
The very young Hautlence brand was founded in 2004 and pays tribute to the "cradle of watchmaking" with their name, an anagram of Neuchatel. The company finds inspiration in the principles of architecture, and the majority of its calibres are produced in-house. </p>

            <p class="box">The first of Hautlence's in-house calibres, the HL, and its correlating collection were presented in 2005; the sports range, the HLS models, were derived from this calibre and were introduced in 2007. In 2009, the company presented a round calibre with a new integrated date function with their HLQ line, and followed it a year later with their third line of calibres, the HLC range. After four years of research and development, Hautlence launched the first of their Concept d'Exception line in 2011 with a new approach to jumping hour hands and retrograde minute dials.</p>
